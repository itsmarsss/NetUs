            <h4>About me</h4>
            <p>
                My name is Yoshikage Kira. I’m 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all
                the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get
                home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don’t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I’m in bed by 11 PM, and
                make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about
                twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just
                like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.

                I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I’m trying to explain that I’m a person who wishes
                to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing,
                that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what
                brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn’t lose to anyone.
            </p>
